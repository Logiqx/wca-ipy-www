This project started on the [SpeedSolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/) forum.

It contains a number of Jupyter Notebooks (iPython / iPy) to produce reports for the senior cubing community.

The reports are now hosted on [GitHub pages](https://logiqx.github.io/wca-ipy/).
