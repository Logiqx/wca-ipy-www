# wca-ipy

This project started on the [SpeedSolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/) forum.

It contains a number of Jupyter Notebooks (iPython / iPy) to produce reports for the senior cubing community.

Currently Available:

* [Partial Over-40's Rankings](Partial_Rankings.md) was only intended to be a one-off but has been maintained since 2015
* [Representative Over-40's Rankings](Senior_Rankings.md) adds anonymised counts to the partial rankings, thus showing all over-40's
* [Percentile Rankings](Percentile_Rankings.md) shows how times are distributed for the WCA community and the over-40's
